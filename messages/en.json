        "category": "business",
        "question": "Why isn't SecureVault open source?",
        "answer": "We chose not to open source for several important reasons:\n\n1. **Security Considerations**: Open source code may expose encryption implementation details, providing opportunities for malicious attackers to reverse engineer.\n\n2. **Business Sustainability**: Developing high-quality security software requires significant time and resource investment. Commercial operation ensures continuous product development and maintenance.\n\n3. **Professional Support**: Closed source model allows us to provide professional technical support and timely security updates.\n\n4. **Intellectual Property Protection**: Protecting our proprietary security algorithm optimizations and user experience designs.\n\n5. **Quality Control**: Unified development and testing processes ensure software stability and security.\n\nWe understand the value of the open source community, but for security tools, professional closed source development better protects user data security."

        "question": "What encryption algorithm is used?",
        "answer": "SecureVault uses military-grade AES-256 encryption algorithm, which is currently the industry-recognized most secure symmetric encryption standard. Combined with PBKDF2 key derivation function and random salt values, it ensures that even identical files produce different encryption results."
